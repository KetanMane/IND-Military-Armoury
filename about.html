        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m someone who believes the best way to learn is to build cool stuff and break a few things along the way(intentionally, haha).
        My journey into web development started with curiosity and a lot of late-night Googling. Fast forward, and Iâ€™ve built projects that mix creativity with purpose
      </p>
      <p class="slide-in">
        One of my proudest projects is the <strong>Indian Military Armoury</strong> website. It gives users a brief but powerful overview of the Indian Armyâ€™s arsenal like jets, submarines, rifles, and more, making tech and defense knowledge accessible in a clean, visually engaging way!
      </p>
      <p class="slide-in">
        I love blending storytelling with technology, and whether itâ€™s front-end finesse or back-end logic puzzles, Iâ€™m always game for the challenge.
        Outside of code? Youâ€™ll find me obsessing over UI animations or pretending to debug while actually vibing to music, lol
